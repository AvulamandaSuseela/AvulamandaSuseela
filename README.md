PROGECT : Telegram NodeMCU Based Home Automation

OBJECTIVE : The objective of a Telegram NodeMCU-based home automation system is to remotely control and monitor household devices using the Telegram messaging app in conjunction with a NodeMCU microcontroller.
This system aims to provide an easy-to-use, cost-effective, and flexible solution for home automation.
Modules Used In Project :

Numpy, Pandas.

STEPS :

1.NodeMCU Microcontroller: Acts as the central controller, connected to Wi-Fi to communicate with Telegram and handle commands.
2.Relay Modules: Switches to control home appliances (e.g., lights, fans) via signals from the NodeMCU.
3.Sensors: Monitor environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, motion) and send data to the NodeMCU.
4.Telegram Bot: Interface for users to send commands and receive updates from the home automation system via the Telegram app.

CONCLUSION :Implementing a Telegram NodeMCU-based home automation system offers a powerful and accessible solution for modernizing household control and monitoring. By leveraging the NodeMCU microcontroller and the widely-used Telegram messaging platform, users can achieve a high degree of convenience, security, and efficiency in managing their home environments.
